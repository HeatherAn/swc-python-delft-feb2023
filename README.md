# Software Carpentry Workshop at Delft University of Technology

[![CC BY 4.0][cc-by-image]][cc-by]

This is the repository containing all materials used and developed for teaching the **Programming with Python** lesson, during the **Software Carpentry Workshop** at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) on February 2023. 

During the workshop the instructor worked with **JupyterLab** (v 3.4.4) from **Anaconda** (v 2.3.2), using `base` environment and **Python** (v 3.9.13) on **Windows 10** Enterprise operating system. 

Libraries used:  
```
glob2      0.7  
matplotlib 3.5.2  
numpy      1.21.5  
```

## Content

The materials have been adapted from the [**Programming with Python**](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) lesson provided by the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/). 

The following files and directories correspond to the **original data** from the [**Programming with Python**](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) lesson:

```
./code/argv_list.py
./code/arith.py
./code/check.py
./code/count_stdin.py
./code/gen_inflammation.py
./code/line_count.py
./code/my_ls.py
./code/readings_*.py
./code/rectangle.py
./code/sys_version.py
./data/inflammation-*.csv
./data/small-*.csv
```

The following files have been reused from the [software_carpentry_learner](https://github.com/mwakok/software_carpentry_learner) repository developed by **Maurits Kok**:

```
./exercises_day1.ipynb
./exercises_day2.ipynb
./solutions/*
```

The following files have been created during the workshop (**to-be-updated**). 

It is important mention that image files generated during the workshop (i.e. `.png` files) have not been included in this repository.
